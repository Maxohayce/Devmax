                <div className="about-text">
                    <p>Hello! My name is Maxwell and I enjoy creating beautiful web experiences. I'm well versed in embracing search engine related considerations and security in creating the perfect experience. I started my coding journey in 2020 through an internship with Genesys Tech Hub.</p>
                    <p>I've been able to internalize some of the concepts learned and turn them into beautiful user experiences as shown in the projects. I was given the Desmond Doss award for going beyond in making sure collaborative efforts were successful and all deliverables were met in the course of the training. After a short while I had the privilege of being a part of the Zuri internship where I worked as backend Engineer.</p>
                    <p>Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on a variety of stack while coming across developers of different background</p>
